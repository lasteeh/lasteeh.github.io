          <h2>The Bob Ross Story</h2>
          <article>
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <h3>Early On</h3>
            <p>
              Robert Norman Ross was born in Daytona, Florida, on October 29,
              1942 to Jack and Ollie Ross. From his mother Bob learned a love
              and respect of wildlife. Bob's father was a carpenter and for a
              short time Bob worked with him but after an unfortunate accident
              where Bob cut off one of his fingers he decided that carpentry
              wasn't for him and in 1960 he joined the Air Force.

            <h3>Learning to Paint</h3>
            <p>
              Bob Ross had his first stationed in Florida before being
              transferred to an airbase in Alaska. It was during his time there
              that he decided to take his first painting lesson at a U.S.O. Club
              in Anchorage. To supplement his income in the Air Force, Bob took
              on a job as a bartender and sold his landscape paintings on gold
              prospecting pans to tourists.
            </p>
            <p>
              After leaving the Air Force and returning to Florida, Bob pursued
              his passion for art by attending various art schools and painting
              classes. It was during this time that he discovered the
              "wet-on-wet" painting technique being taught by William Alexander.
              Bob dedicated himself to experimenting and refining this
              technique, eventually creating his own unique version. He also
              developed custom-made paints, brushes, and knives specifically
              designed for his wet-on-wet approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Bob Ross wet-on-wet technique, also known as "alla prima" or
              "direct painting," allowed artists to complete their work in a
              single session. This technique has a rich history in art, dating
              back to the 16th century. Throughout the centuries, renowned
              artists such as Jan van Eyck, Diego Velázquez, Thomas
              Gainsborough, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, John Singer Sargent,
              and even modern artists like Willem de Kooning have employed
              variations of the alla prima technique in their own unique ways.

            <h3>Teaching Others to Paint</h3>
            <p>
              Bob's passion for painting and his desire to share it with others
              led him and his partners to launch the Joy of Painting on public
              television in 1982. With the television show as a platform, Bob
              embarked on a journey across America to teach painting to
              interested individuals. Initially, the classes held in shopping
              malls and art stores attracted only small groups of students.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, as the popularity of the TV show grew, so did the live
              audiences for Bob's public lessons. From 1982 to 1994, he recorded
              over 400 episodes of The Joy of Painting, solidifying its status
              as one of the most beloved and well-known shows on public
              television. Even today, the show continues to captivate audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bob's dedication to teaching and inspiring others continues to
              thrive through the countless instructors who carry on his method
              worldwide. His legacy lives on as they pass on his techniques and
              share his love for painting with aspiring artists around the
              globe.

            <h3>A Media Darling</h3>
            <p>
              Although he might seem shy and retiring Bob was a savvy media
              personality. He often reached out to his viewers for ideas and
              shared their successes with his audience. He was regularly asked
              to appear on talk shows where he entranced the live studio
              audiences. He famously recorded a promo for MTV when the network
              was still young and growing.

            <h3>Something For Everyone</h3>
            <p>
              Dedicated fans include Baby Boomers, Millennials, and Generation
              Zs alike who enjoy and appreciate the happy little trees, friendly
              clouds and happy accidents that can make the noise and whirlwind
              of their everyday lives a little easier to take in. There is also
              some science behind the dulcet tones of Bob's voice and the gentle
              tap-tap-tapping of the two inch brush. For many fans Bob is the
              “King of ASMR” the audio sensory meridian response that keeps
              people tuned in and watching his every move. He can can also be
              found today at the forefront of an exciting and inspirational
              wellness movement.

            <h3>And The Beat Goes On</h3>
            <p>
              Bob Ross's influence remains prevalent in today's digital
              landscape, as evidenced by the multitude of tributes and parodies
              dedicated to him that can be found across the internet. From
              Twitter to YouTube, and even within professional sports teams, fan
              appreciation for Bob knows no boundaries. His universal appeal
              attracts people from all walks of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              One remarkable testament to Bob's enduring popularity was the
              launch of the Bob Ross channel on the interactive gaming platform
              Twitch. The channel featured a continuous marathon of The Joy of
              Painting, which garnered an impressive 5.6 million unique views.
              The overwhelming response included thousands of requests for more
              episodes even after the series concluded.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bob's distinctive artistic style has inspired countless imitators,
              and copycat versions of his artworks are widely available. While
              Bob generously donated many of his works to public television
              stations to assist with fundraising, you can still catch a glimpse
              of an original painting from the show. The Bob Ross Workshop in
              New Smyrna Beach, Florida, stands as the ultimate destination to
              appreciate his original pieces. The workshop houses a vast
              collection of his paintings and offers classes in the Bob Ross
              method, providing aspiring artists with the opportunity to become
              certified Bob Ross instructors in landscape, florals, and wildlife
              painting.
