          <h2>The Mounts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>The Raptor</h3>
              <p>
                Raptors are hardy and swift, and surprisingly easy to train due
                to their intelligence. They can cross great distances in a
                single leap, making them the favored mount of many of the
                desert's denizens. Travelers are advised not to leave the city
                of Amnoon without obtaining a raptor companion.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>The Springer</h3>
              <p>
                Their long ears and wiggly noses are charming, but the
                springer's greatest strength is their ability to make
                jaw-dropping vertical leaps. Traveling merchants and couriers
                use them to cross sheer cliffs in the Crystal Highlands, shaving
                weeks off their journeys.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Skimmer</h3>
              <p>
                Skimmers are graceful creatures native to the Elon River. They
                live above water, breathing through large air sacs as they float
                above the surface. While they cannot truly fly, they can hover
                for short distances at a height of several norn, making them
                indispensable for crossing large areas of treacherous quicksand
                or sulfur.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Jackal</h3>
              <p>
                Jackals are elusive, magical creatures formed of shifting sands
                and given shape by magical runes. They can dissipate into sand
                to teleport short distances and dash through sand portals. The
                djinn of the Desolation create and tame them; prove yourself a
                worthy trainer, and you may befriend one.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Griffon</h3>
              <p>
                Despite weighing as much as a dolyak, the elusive giant griffon
                can glide at high altitudes and even take off breifly from the
                ground. The Mordant Crescent is acting to suppress recent rumors
                of griffon riders in the desert skies, and you have quite a
                journey ahead if you'd like one for yourself.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Roller Beetle</h3>
              <p>
                Roller beetles can cross vast stretches of sand dunes i the
                blink of an eye by curling into a ball to gather momentum.
                Controlling beetles gracefully at top speed requires skill and
                finess, encouraging their fans to form competitive racing
                networks across Tyria.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Warclaw</h3>
              <p>
                Discovered by Durmand Priory scholars, warclaws are magical
                constructs bound to armor of uncertain origin. Assembling the
                armore will manifest a fierce and loyal mount to ride in the
                Mists—but you'll need to join the Mist War to find it.
              </p>
              <p>Bond with your Warckaw in the World vs. World.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Skyscale</h3>
              <p>
                Skyscales are a new and mysterious draconic life form. They use
                their powerful wings to lift into the air from the ground and
                maintain altitude and can cling to walls to regain their
                strength. With a skyscale companion, you'll reach heights you've
                only dreamed of.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Siege Turtle</h3>
              <p>
                Siege Turtle can bear two riders: one to handle the turtle. and
                another to operate the weapons strapped to its shell. Raise your
                own walking war machine and take a friend out for combat
                adventures!
